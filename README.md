# mongolian_editor

This is a simple editor for writing Mongolian script. It uses a `MongolTextField` from the Flutter [mongol](https://pub.dev/packages/mongol) package.

There is no built in IME so you will need to use your own. [Here](http://www.studymongolian.net/technical/mongolian-keyboard-for-macos/) is one for Mac.

Check out the editor in action on [suragch.dev](https://suragch.dev/apps/mongoleditor).
